# Image Optimizer

Optimize image(s) using the google squoosh lib (supported formats: png/jpg).

You can compress/resize one image or an entire directory. This tool can be used as a part of any workflow (lambda function, git hook, etc.)

Configuration options can be found here: https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/tree/dev/libsquoosh#preprocessing-and-encoding-images

The default configuration can be aligned at the config.json file.

The path of the folder is stored in a DIR_NAME env variable.
